# DEV Guide

When making custom CSS you don't want to overwrite existing class except the ones I created, don't get me wrong, you can change existing classes, but it's not recommended.
The file you want to edit is in `/boot/config/plugins/folder.view/styles`, it's plain CSS, so you will need to know CSS before doing something.
You can find the template used for creating the folder in their respective folder named `template.html` and the default CSS in `template.css`, you can't change the template.html because it is hard-coded into the plugin, so any visual modification should be done trough CSS.
This is it, have fun.
Once done you can publish it [here](https://github.com/scolcipitato/folder.view.custom-css), you can fork it and make a PR or just send it to me and I will add it to the repo.
