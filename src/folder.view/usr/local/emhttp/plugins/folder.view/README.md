####FolderView###
FolderView lets you create folders for grouping Dockers and VMs together to help with organization. Especially useful if you're using docker-compose.
Getting Started: A new button named "Add Folder" will appear at the bottom of the docker and VM tab(s) next to "Add Container", depending on whether they are enabled in Settings or not.
